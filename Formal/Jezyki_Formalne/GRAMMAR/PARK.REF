This program will move the heads on your SEAGATE ST213, ST225, ST238R,
ST225N or ST251N hard disks to their dedicated LANDING ZONE.  This process
is recommended prior to ANY physical relocation of the computer or removal
of the hard disk drives for any reason.

You will then be prompted:


     You should TURN OFF the computer after running this program.
